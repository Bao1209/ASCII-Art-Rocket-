ASCII Art(Rocket)
The objective of this assignment is to let you practice control flow structures in C++. It also involves 
the use of variables, operators, expressions, and standard input/output to reinforce your learning in 
the course thus far. You are to write a program to draw a rocket pattern using characters in the ASCII 
character set as console output.

This is an example of ASCII art which has a long history dating back to as early as 1966. Some ASCII 
arts such as the above follow certain rules of regular patterns and can be reproduced in a systematic 
manner using loops and conditionals. In this assignment, instead of “hardcoding” the drawings, you 
are required to use loops and conditionals to print the various parts of the rocket shape, whose size 
parameters like height and width are variables and are controlled by the user via standard input.
